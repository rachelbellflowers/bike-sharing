# Factors that Influence the Use of Bike-Sharing Programs

Bike-sharing programs allow individuals to rent a bike at one location and then leave it at another location. Often found in cities, these programs help citizens avoid traffic and travel around quicker than walking. With over 500 bike-sharing programs in existence, it is clear that this model has gained traction. Given that these bicycles have tracking software that records who is riding, for how long, and their final destination, data about the use of such programs is easily available. 

Data from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington, D.C. were used to determine what factors contribute to higher usage of rental bikes on a daily basis in the years 2011 and 2012. Started in 2008, the Capital Bikeshare program has over 500 stations spanned across the nation's capital, Virginia, and Maryland.
